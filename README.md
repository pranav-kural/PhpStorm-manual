# PhpStorm-manual
A manual on usage of Jetbrain's most popular web development IDE - PhpStorm.

## Following are the purposes of this manual:
   1. Provide user with all the information required to set up the IDE successfully.
   2. Provide adequate instructions on using IDE efficiently.
   3. Provide information about all the functionalities of the IDE.
   4. Providing the software licensing and redistribution policy information.
   5. Provide an email address, link to online documentation and other contact information and
   resources that the user may rely on in case of any problem with the product.

## Audience Analysis:
PhpStrom is an all-in-one integrated development environment for any kind of web development,
therefore the audience for this product mainly includes wed developers and developer students. This product and its
manual may be used directly for professional development or for educational purposes. Our analysis reveal that
primary users are male between the age of 22 to 49. Most of the new users of this manual will have some background
in web development, especially with PHP programming language or are already a user of other JetBrains products.
Since, this downloadable product is only available online, any user with internet connection anywhere in the world
can download it. Although most of the members are impressed by the improvement in their development speed due
to the usage of this IDE, some find it overwhelming at times with too much functionality being available at a time.

## The task analysis reveal three main tasks this manual must address:
1. Setting up the IDE for first time for PHP development. User may also need brief information about
using other technologies as well like JavaScript, Ruby and PHP frameworks.
2. How to create a new project. User may need all the information required to start a new project
with certain requirements and details of pre-installed tools and frameworks for setting up a
project quickly.
3. How to perform basic operations in a development project. User may want information regarding
testing, debugging and documenting the project files.
4. How to publish the project. User will need information on how to deploy the project on the
required platform.
5. How to change basic settings of the IDE. User may want to change the appearance or shortcuts
key scheme for the development in IDE.

## Design Plans
Based on our analysis we suggest designing a manual that is clear and concise, with more emphasis on visuals and
actual and relevant examples from the IDE itself. The manual is expected to represents JetBrains brand in its design
and appeal.

### Rough outline 
Cover with JetBrains brand logo, PhpStorm logo, and the companyâ€™s moto.

   Inside front cover: Details about the company. Product usage, redistribution and licensing
   information.
   
   First section: Images and screenshots of the IDE for setting up the IDE environment for first time,
   from downloading and installing to making it development ready.
   
   Second section: Visuals depicting on how to set up or create a new project from the very start or
   using a template.
   
   Third section: Detailed list of various important task that could be performed using the IDE while
   working with a project.
   
   Fourth section: Display the instructions to deploy or publish a project, using graphics and list of
   numbered steps.
   
   Fifth section: Using visuals and bulleted list to provide information on editing the work
   environment in IDE and making it more user centric.
   
## Production guidelines 
Since, this manual has to be stringent on following the design format and structure as used by
JetBrains brand in all other manuals, it must use only black, white and blue colors all over the
document, except for images. All images related to the IDE will be using either the JetBrains
default IntelliJ theme or the JetBrains Dracula theme. We suggest using black ink on white paper
for normal text, while using blue ink for highlighting and emphasis. 

### Manual under development. Schedule (for github):
    PhpStorm Manual v1.0 - July 29, 2016 : Before Testing
    PhpStorm Manual v1.1 - August 3, 2016 : After implementing changes required as per testing
